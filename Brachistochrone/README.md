# Nature Inspired Optimisation Algorithms on the Brachistochrone problem

This project is an offshoot of my Extended Project Qualification "To what extent does an inspiration from Nature result in the creation of an effective Optimisation Algorithm?"

The code BrachistochroneVisualise when executed prompts the user which algorithm they would like to use, after which a pygame GUI shows the algorithm iteratively solving the Brachistochrone problem for 500 iterations.

### Prerequisites

The code was programmed in Python 3.8.0, and uses the external libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pygame and cma. Once Python is installed, the following script in Adminstrator Command Prompt will download the relevant libraries:

```
pip install numpy, scipy, pygame, cma
```

## The Brachistochrone Problem

The Brachistochrone Problem, posed by Bernouilli in 1696, essentially asks the question "What is the shape of the curve which a mass slides from point A to point B in the least time?" A helpful animation on Wikipedia illustrates the solution to this problem:
